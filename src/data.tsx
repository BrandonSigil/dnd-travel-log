        description: "The Cliffside ward makes up the lower edge of Sharn, built on and into the cliffs that drop toward the river. This waterfront district, full of businesses that cater to the sailors who pass through Sharn’s port, can be a rough and tumble place. Legitimate services can be found here—ships need supplies and repairs, goods need to be stored, and captains need a place to hire a crew.",

The dark side of this open-mindedness comes in a high incidence of crime and corruption. With most of its wealth and power coming from industry, this land has Sharn, as its crown jewel.",

However, the country has a rugged beauty, a proud, stoic people with a strong sense of honor and community, and great food. King Kaius has been the strongest advocate of peace among the leaders of Khorvaire.",
